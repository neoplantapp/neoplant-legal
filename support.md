## Quick fixes

### I can’t see subscription prices
If prices show as “Price shown in App Store” or similar, it usually means the App Store hasn’t returned pricing yet (for example, the subscription is still in review, or you’re not on a TestFlight/App Store build).  
Try again later, or update to the latest version.

### Purchase failed / no purchase returned
This can happen if the subscription isn’t available for purchase yet in the App Store, or if there’s a temporary store connection issue.  
- Make sure you’re on the latest version
- Try again on a stable network
- If it still fails, email support with a screenshot

### Restore doesn’t work
Restoring only works if you previously purchased using the **same Apple ID**.
1. Tap **Restore** on the paywall or Profile screen
2. Wait a few seconds
3. If nothing restores, confirm you’re signed into the correct Apple ID (Settings → Apple ID → Media & Purchases)

### How do I cancel my subscription?
Subscriptions are managed by Apple:
- iPhone Settings → your name → **Subscriptions**
- Select **NeoPlant Pro** → Cancel

### Refunds
Refunds are handled by Apple. You can request one through Apple’s refund flow.
